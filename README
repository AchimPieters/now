## Now

### DESCRIPTION

Now is a command-line application that outputs the current date and/or time according to a given (.NET) format.
The output is always a single line, so it can easily be used in batch scripts. Now is also a handy tool to learn to use .NET's way of formatting dates and times. The culture can also be set.

    Usage: now [format] <culture>
